USAGE

	1. Copy jet9-multitask-init to /etc/jet9-multitask-init
	2. Copy freebsd-multitask-init.sh to /etc/freebsd-multitask-init.sh
	3. Apply rc.patch to /etc/rc

	This patch replaces sequential execution of late stage scripts with
	parallel one. The `rcorder` is used only to select scripts by keywords,
	but the real order jet9-multitask-init determines itself from scripts'
	annotations with task_dependencies() function. The execution is done in
	topologically order (strict partial order) defined by dependencies.

	It supports REQUIRE, BEFORE and PROVIDE annotations.


NOTE

	The script defines many variables in the shell context and it doesn't clean
	them up before run_rc_script called. This behaviour should be fixed later.
