USAGE

	1. Copy jet9-multitask-init to /etc/jet9-multitask-init
	2. Copy .init.sh to /etc/rc.d/.init.sh
	3. Apply rc.patch to /etc/rc

	This patch replaces sequential execution of late stage scripts with
	parallel one. The `rcorder` is used only to select scripts by keywords,
	but the real order jet9-multitask-init determines itself from scripts'
	annotations with task_dependencies() function. The execution is done in
	topologically order (strict partial order) defined by dependencies.

	It supports REQUIRE, BEFORE and PROVIDE annotations.


NOTE

	The script defines some variables in the shell context and doesn't clean
	it up before run_rc_script called. It can be fixed later.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS

	Script and dependency names should have only alphanumeric or underscore
	chars, without hyphen, dot and others.

	Scripts should be placed in single directory (/etc/rc.d)
