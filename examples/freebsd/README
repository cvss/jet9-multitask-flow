USAGE

	1. Copy jet9-multitask-init to /etc/jet9-multitask-init
	2. Copy freebsd-multitask-init.sh to /etc/freebsd-multitask-init.sh
	3. Apply rc.patch to /etc/rc

	This patch replaces sequential execution of late stage scripts with
	parallel one. The `rcorder` is used only to select scripts by keywords,
	but the real order jet9-multitask-init determines itself from scripts'
	annotations with task_dependencies() function. The execution is done in
	topologically order (strict partial order) defined by dependencies.

	It supports REQUIRE, BEFORE and PROVIDE annotations.


NOTE

	The script defines many variables in the shell context and it doesn't clean
	them up before run_rc_script called. This behaviour should be fixed later.


KNOWN BUGS

	Currently task_dependencies() runs awk three times for each script to
	extract all kinds of dependencies and it spend a lot of time. For 160
	scripts it took about 0.5 second. It can be rewritten to single awk run
	for all kinds of dependencies and all scripts to reduce the execution
	time down to few milliseconds.
